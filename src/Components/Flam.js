            The impossibly pretty village of Flam located in the fjords,
            Southwestern Norway – one of the best regions to explore in Norway.
            Home to museums that truly showcase and highlight the history of
            this city, as a visitor, you’ll be able to go on an explorative
            journey with the Flam Railway, which will show you the city in a way
            that you can only imagine.
