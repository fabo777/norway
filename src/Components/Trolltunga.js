          Otherwise known as the ‘troll’s tongue’ it was formed during the ice
          age when a glacial water froze a hunk of this mountain and caused it
          to break off, leaving a thin protruding ledge which hovers about 2,300
          feet above the lake below. If you’re up for the challenge, it’s only a
          mere four-hour trek for a photo opportunity of a lifetime!
